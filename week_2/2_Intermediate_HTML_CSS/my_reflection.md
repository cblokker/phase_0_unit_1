# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?  

I think web standards help developers follow best practices, which makes collaboration much easier.

* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?  

I think so. Still a little confused with @font-face.  It seems unnecessary to me.  Apparently it improves performance?  And what's up with all those font formats?

* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?

I don't know yet.  I guess it's good to have default elements like header and footer that are customary to use.  It makes the HTML cleaner, because you don't have to use a crap load of divs.  And you can always override the default element styles.

* Why is reset.css necessary?  

   HTML tags have default styles, which might interfere with our custom styles.  Therefore, it was necessary for the 'women in computing' exercise.  In other scenarios, it might not be necessary if you want to preserve default element styles.
   
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?

Chrome and Firefox.  I have noticed that sites look different on different browsers.  This is a really bad thing because developers have to worry about what the site looks like in every browser, and adhere to every browser standard.  
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
