# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?

The DOM is a programming interface for HTML documents.  It's essentially a standard that connects web pages to programming languages, such as JavaScript (think AJAX and JQUERY).  These languages can then make the website dynamic - it does this through the DOM.

* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?

It actually looked very similar!  There was a head, body, nav, ul, and other familiar html elements in the worpress site I looked at.  My website used some of the same elements.

* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?

It was helpful when looking at padding and margin to figure out where I was going wrong.  Having said that, I found using Chrome Web Tools to be a pain to work with.  There's a lot going on there, and I feel that it's layout isn't the most intuitive.

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?

I thought it was pretty cool how you could edit the html right there in the web tool.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I just used the ones provided.  The code school videos really helped!
