* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0?

My biggest time management challenge is the fact that I get easily distracted.  I'm not sure why, but it's probably because I never make a conscious effort to avoid these distractions.  In general, I'd say it takes me longer to accomplish tasks when compared to others.  This is probably in part due to how easily distracted I am,  but it’s also due to my slower mind.  I don’t mean that I’m slow in the sense that I’m ‘dumb’, I just feel like I tend to mull over concepts for a long time so that I can fully understand them.

* How will you combat that? 

I think self-discipline can really help when it comes to avoiding distractions.  Honestly, I don't try very hard to avoid distractions, because I generally love and embrace these distractions.  Therefore, I will make a conscious effort to avoid these distractions through the pomodoro technique.


* What techniques will you try?

I will try the pomodoro technique.  I'm actually trying it right now. I like it.  It's simple.  Also, I will keep a daily log of my focus, just as a way to become aware of my focus, and get some data to convince myself that I’m changing my behavior.

I like BJ Fogs’ Ted talk about practicing tiny habits.  I think I will start practicing small daily habits.  For example, I seem to frequently lose my car keys because I never place them in the same spot.  They’re either in the pocket of my old pair of pants on the ground, on the kitchen counter, in my bed, on my desk, anywhere.  I probably lose about 5 - 10 minutes a day searching for my keys because I've never developed that habit of placing them in one secure spot.  It's something I've never really thought about before, but it's definitely a source of daily frustration when I'm rushing out the door and can't find my keys.  Small things like these I will practice, along with practicing time management techniques my efficiency with completing phase 0 work.

* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

Luckily, Phase 0 is my primary focus until phase 1.  Therefore, time management isn't as necessary for me as it is for others.  But, after watching all these time management videos, I've realized how important it is.  Therefore, I will take advantage of my free time to focus on time management skills, and create the habits that will make me become a successful dev bootcamper.
