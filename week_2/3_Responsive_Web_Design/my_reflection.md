# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?

Responsive web design is designing a web site for different types of displays: desktops, smartphones, and tablets.  I think it makes sense to design for different types of displays because you never know who's accessing your site from what type of display.  It's obviously good practice to design a responsive website, but it might not be necessary, depending on the function of the site.

* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?

Smartphones have made web designers consider mobile applications - like using maps and gps.  Also, since smartphone and tablet screens are generally smaller than other desktop or laptop screens, web designers have to figure out how to place all the necessary information into a smaller screen size.  Another thing to consider is the difference between using a mouse and using a touch screen.  When using a mouse pointer, it takes time for the user to move the pointer across the screen, that's why it makes sense the place all the 'buttons' right next to each other.  But with a touch screen, the user can press anywhere on the screen at the same rate.  This allows buttons to be more spread out and larger in size.

* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?

I'm not sure how they use the web.  They might use applications that can convert text to voice. I think we should consider alternative designs for the visually impaired, while at the same time keeping a design for the non-visually impaired.  The primary audience will most likely be people who can see perfectly well.  Web designers don't want to sacrifice good design to satisfy a secondary audience.  One can place a visually impaired button on the screen to link to a better website for them.

* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?

I love the media queries!  They're pretty awesome and easy to use when you want to design for specific window widths.  Also, using percentages instead of pixels is a cool trick.


* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I used some stack exchange to answer some simple questions.  Other than that, the resources provided were pretty helpful.
