# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: http://cblokker.github.io/

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience?

I learned that design and user experience are very important when it comes to people wanting to come back to your website.  If there's a frustrating user experience, there is the good possibility that the user will become fed up, and go to another website.  I learned that there are some general rules of thumb for design and user experience.


* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

I do enjoy design and user experience.  I think I have a good eye for it, but it takes awhile to get to your intended end result.

* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?

I used the pomorodo technique and found that it greatly helped my workflow.  I would spend the first 25 minutes reading the section and reading watching the links provided.  Then I'd take a five-minute break.  I'd then go ahead and try to apply what I just learned in the next 25 minutes, trying to avoid googling the answer (but I gave in a couple times).  I'd take another 5-minute break and give it another 25-minute try.  If I needed to do more research, I’d do it in another 25-minute chunk.

* What would you like to add or change about the site next?

I want to add an about me section to my aside.  This will have a fixed positioning, just like my photo.  Also, id like to have even margins for the links.  Right now they're more towards the left of the section, which is not what I wanted.  

* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?

There were some moments of frustration, and but since I'm already fairly familiar with html and css, it wasn't that bad.  I'd never been exposed to the media queries before, so that was super cool!

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I looked at other students’ blogs and code for inspiration.
