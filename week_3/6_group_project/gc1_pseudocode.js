// My role in the group is: Person 2, pseudocode.

// Here is my part of the challenge:

// test by using node.  Instal it if you haven't already.
//
// 1. open terminal
// 2. navigate your way to the file's path by using bash commands ls and cd
// 3. once you're in the folder that holds the js file, type node gc1_initial_solution.js (or whatever its called).
// 4. see it fail, and try to fix it line by line by writing the following functions:

// write a function called sum, with an array parameter called arr
// // initialize a variable integer called sum and set it equal to zero
// // write a for loop that starts at index zero and ends at index array.length, incrementing by one each time
// // // set the sum equal to the array at the current index plus sum
// // end the loop
// // return sum
// end function


// write a function called mean, with an array parameter called arr
// // return the mean by calling the sum function that we wrote above, and pass in arr as its parameter. Divite this value by the length of the array
// end function
//


// write a function called median, with an array parameter called array
// // sort array from smallest to biggest by using array.sort() built in function
// // create a variable called half and set it equal to the array length divided by 2 (make sure to Math.floor this value).
// // if the array length is even, then return the integer in the middle of the array.  In other words, return array at index half.
// // if the array lenght is odd, then return the sum of the two middle integers divided my two.  In other words, return array at index haf plus array at index half - 1, then divide that by 2
// end function
