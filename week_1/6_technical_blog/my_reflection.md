## 8. [Comparing Favorite Websites](8_technical_blog/readme.md) Reflection

Blog url: http://cblokker.github.io/unit1_projects/week1_technical_blog.html

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

It was a very fun and creative process!  I figured out how to place images as backgrounds.  I researched by looking at what other students uploaded to their github accounts.  I also looked at other blogs for inspiration.  The websites I wrote about in the blog are one's I visit on a daily basis.  Even though I'm so familiar with those sites, I found it a bit cumbersome to write about their design, as it's kind of hard to explain those things sometimes.  I feel confident in the way it looks, and less confident in my written analysis.
