Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down.

I've read other people's responses about DBC, and it seems like we're all anxious and excited. This comforts me a bit, as I've realized this is a huge life change for us all.  I know we're all more or less in the same boat :)

I'm anxious about moving to New York - a city I'm unfamiliar with, and I don't know a single person who lives out there (but I know a few friends of friends).
