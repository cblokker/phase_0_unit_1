I didn't know what a 'pseudo-class' was. Well, I knew what it was, just not what it was called.  I used a :hover pseudo-class.

Absolute vs relative positioning is a bit tricky.

I learned about spans :)

I'm able to position HTML elements using CSS padding, borders, and margins.  It get's a little complicated when there's a lot of divs, but I think that's what wireframing is for.  I used HTML tags like br, a, span, and div.  I'm sure there's a lot more.

I had fun playing with the CSS and seeing how I can make the page look different.

I found following the specific instructions a bit tedius.  I kind of just wanted to get in there and experiment!  But I understand, you want to make sure we can do specific things and follow directions.
