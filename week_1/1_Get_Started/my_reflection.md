## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
  I already had git and GitHub setup on my computer because I've used it before, so it's nothing new to me.  Although, the github app is new to me (only used terminal before). 

* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience.
  Git is version control software that's installed locally on your machine.  In other words, it allows you to save multiple versions of a file as you're working on it.  It also allows you to create copies of that file so you can work on parallel versions.  GitHub, on the other hand, remotely hosts your files on the internet. It allows you to share and collaborate with multiple machines that also have access to GitHub.  It's like a dropbox for your version controlled git files.  Therefore, git is more like a local file on your machine.

* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
  Version control is a piece of software that allows people to keep track of their progress of a specific file.  For example, with git, as one works on their code, they can 'commit' any changes that have been made to that file. Every commit is like a snapshot of your progress.  This way, if a developer royally screws up on some code, he/she can go back to a previous working version of his/her code, and work from there.  You can then 'push' or upload those commits to GitHub to share with the rest of the world.  This allows for collaboration with people who are also connected to GitHub.  They can then 'pull' or upload your file onto their machine, use git on their machine for version control, then 'merge' their version with your version.

* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
  Developers use version control to collaborate on large projects, keep track of work progress (ensure team members are making regular commits and not falling behind), and to revert back to previous versions of their code if necessary.
  
* What doesn't make sense? What does?
I feel fairly comfortable with the concept of version control.
