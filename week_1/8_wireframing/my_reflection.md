I learned that lots of websites use a basic head, body, footer layout.  From there, customization can be done for uniqueness.

I generally like design and user experience.  It's hard to grasp what makes a good user experience sometimes - a bit of an abstract concept.

I like the wireframe tool balsamiq!  It's makes it fairly easy to wireframe.

I enjoyed seeing design aspects of the website I didn't see after doing the wireframe.  Very helpful.

Just going about the wireframing process and deciding how much detail I want in the wireframes.
