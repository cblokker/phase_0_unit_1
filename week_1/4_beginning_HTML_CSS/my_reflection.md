## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't?

I'm pretty familiar with the basic structure of HTML: the head, the body, using divs, lists...

There's a lot to CSS that I don't know about. I have some trouble working with relative and absolute positioning. It sometimes adds unexpected formatting.

* What seems good and bad about HTML?

HTML is pretty simple if you want to make a 1998 looking webpage.  There are good organization practices in HTML.

HTML kinda looks ugly, both the code itself and the way it looks on the webpage.


* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?

I never really understood the difference between classes and ids.  It appears that classes are intended to be reused, while ids are intended to be unique.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

http://www.w3schools.com/ helped a bit.
