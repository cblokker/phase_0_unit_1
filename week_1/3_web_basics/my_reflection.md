## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection

* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?  

I thought the Internet and the World Wide Web were pretty much synonymous.  Instead, I learned that the Web is a component or subset of the Internet. I thought the 'there's no place like 127.0.0.1' joke was pretty funny.

* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?

index.html is required

for github, you want to name your repo username.github.io

* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?

It felt pretty awesome :)

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?

Just going through the process of setting up the repo, cloning, committing, and pushing helped solidify my understanding of git and GihHub.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

None
