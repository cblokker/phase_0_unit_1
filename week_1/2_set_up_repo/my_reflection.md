## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person  

1. go to your GitHub account
2. under the repositories tab, click 'NEW'
3. add a repo name, description, make it public, and initialize the repo with a README
4. go to your terminal, navigate to your desired path (cd dbc/phase_0) to download the contents of the repo
5. while still in the terminal, type 'git clone REPO_URL. This will copy the contents of REPO_URL into your dbc/phase_0 folder.

* Describe what open source means

If someone's code is open source, then the programmer is allowing the public to view their code.  One can then use snippets of that code for educational purposes or for use in their own projects.

* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?  

I really like the idea.  I believe a lot of software thrives on open source.  Being able to easily access information and share it for free helps developers create better products.  This way, they can make modules, and not rely on building everything from scratch.  Also, it just helps programmers become better programmers because they can see how all the code is written and get feedback from the open source community.

* Assess the importance of using licenses

It's pretty important to use licenses.  You need to specify whether or not your code is open source in order to inform the public, so they know what they can do with your code and avoid any sort of legal ramifications.

* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

Not, really.  I've done this stuff before.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

No, but I did enjoy the smashing magazine article :)
